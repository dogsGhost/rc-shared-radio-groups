# React Component: Unique Multi-Select

A normal radio set allows you to select one unique value exclusive to a set.
This component allows you to select a unique value across multiple sets that share the same set of values.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
